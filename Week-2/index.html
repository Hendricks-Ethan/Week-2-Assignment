        <h1>HELLO THERE!</h1>
            <div class="main-text">
                My Name is Ethan Hendricks. I am 31 and I grew up in Stephen, MN. 
                It is a small town of about 700 and is only 45 miles north of Grand Forks, ND (where I reside now).<br><br>
                I am currently an Assisstant General Mangager at a Bar and Grill called JL Beers. Although 
                I love what I do at the moment, I am very excited to begin my journey through PromineoTech 
                and cannot wait to see the doors this path choice can open!
